<p>Hello readers!</p>

<p>From now on, the canonical url for this feed won't be http://npisanti.com/rss.xml or http://npisanti.com/journal/rss.xml, but: <br><br>
<a href="http://nonmateria.com/rss.xml">http://nonmateria.com/rss.xml</a>
<br><br>Aliases and copies are active to keep the old links working, but you are encouraged to switch to the new link.</p>

<p>Thank you all for the cooperation! =D </p>
