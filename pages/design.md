For my website I wanted something based on those principles:

* offline first: I should be able to view and work on it without having an internet connection
* statically generated from plain HTML+CSS, no Javascript, no cookies. no databases or PHP servers needed
* no embedded surveillance capitalism, this means no SEO, no embedded Youtube or Google Fonts
* pixelperfect graphics should remain pixelperfect
* images and videos compressed as much as possible improve loading speed, artifacts can be embraced as an aesthetic trait

This site is generated by a [script](https://codeberg.org/nonmateria/nonmateria-ssg/) counting less than 400 lines of code. It is also a proof that shell scripting, although not very efficient, can be a viable way for generating small to medium websites. For frequently edited platforms like a wiki or a [memex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex) a more performant language would have been a better fit, but for posting on my blog less than once a week a [fish](https://fishshell.com/) shell script is just enough.

All the images are optimized with optipng and jpegoptim, and resized to the section width (with full size versions on click). Videos are compressed to something like 500kb/s at HD resolution. About 60 lines of CSS are used for styling. Links don't open in a new tab by default, leaving the choice to the reader.

You can check out the site generator source code [here](https://codeberg.org/nonmateria/nonmateria-ssg/src/branch/main/build.sh).
