Profeticomatico is a work i made with <a href="http://antoniopipolo.com/">Antonio Pipolo</a>: It's an ironic oracle ispired both by to the zodiac, the tarots and other divination methods and by some italian comic movies from the 70s and 80s. It uses simple grammatical procedures and a small dictionary to generate responses that vary from the total nonsense to the strangely meaningful, united randomly selected and glitched illustrations. Made with Raspberry Pi 2, Arduino and the Adafruit Thermal Printer.<br>
