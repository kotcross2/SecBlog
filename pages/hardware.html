<p>There are some years that I practice what many people in the world call "creative coding": using code and crafting computer programs as mean of expression.</p> 

<p>Although the general trend in this field is to be enthusiast about every latest software framework, vaporware device or fashionable tech, I started being unsatisfied with this modus operandi, even more as it clearly goes against <a href="SITEROOTPATH/pages/objects.html">my ethics</a> on objects. What many people call "innovation" can be equally called a <a href="http://viznut.fi/texts-en/resource_leak_bug_of_our_civilization.html">bug of our civilization</a> by others.</p> 

<p>So I made a selection on the hardware and software I was using the most, and I started to rewrite my tools from scratch with less dependencies, to keep my things running on second hand gear and stop being forced to chase the "latest and greatest" stuff I don't actually need.</p>

<p> My workstation is an Asus Zenbook UX303LA. It's named "lazarus" as it <a href="SITEROOTPATH/data/extradoc/lazarus.jpg">died once</a>, due to a faulty design, and then resurrected. It has the low power version of the Intel i5 processor (4th gen) for a good balance between energy usage and processing power, with an integrated video card supporting openGL 3.3 (I love to code shaders).</p>
