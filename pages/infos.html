	<p> Hello traveler, this is an abstract garden located at the very outskirts of the internet, where the inventions of <a href="vessel.html">this</a> entity spawn. 
    </p>
    The <a href="../main/index.html">main</a> section of this site is a curated (and sometimes not chronological) blog feed. Posts are also divided into chronologically ordered "channels" containing more posts than the main feed:
    <ul>
    <li><a href="../ink/index.html">ink</a> contains a lot more doodles</li>
    <li><a href="../gizmos/index.html">gizmos</a> installations and fictional devices</li>
    <li><a href="../music/index.html">music</a>: livecoded, generative, jams and experiments (mostly unmastered)</li>
    <li><a href="../visuals/index.html">visuals</a>: code-based graphics and interactions</li>
	</ul>

    <p>This site is part of a  <a href="https://webring.xxiivv.com/">webring</a>, an index of finely crafted websites that redirect traffic to each other.</p>

    <p>Up ahead you can find pages about my tools, works or other various ramblings.</a>

	<p>I vastly prefer minimal solutions over bloated fully-featured software. As removing features and simplifying code is not in the corporate agendas anymore, open source software has became the only way to have instruments that are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worse_is_better">simple</a>, reliable, <a href="https://tonsky.me/blog/disenchantment/">efficient</a> and long-standing.</p>

    I code and mantain some of my own tools and code snippets:<br>
